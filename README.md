This is an atm program written for a class assignment. The goal was to create a program to run an ATM maachine with certain features. 

Features: 
1. Display balance
2. Receipt (If yes, say it is virtual.)
3. Withdrawal
4. Deposit

The user could only use ATM with correct PIN. Three tries to get it correct. The limits of deposit and withdrawal plus other design elements were based upon instructions of the assignment.
